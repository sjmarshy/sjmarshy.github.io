I have an issue. I can't work out if it's an issue with me, or with how
e-readers handle ebooks. It's possible it's me, but I'm guessing not. I haven't
spent what you'd call a lot of time thinking about it, but I figured I can use
the problem as an excuse to play with something. It also happens to combine
a new area for me with development and user experience, so I'm happy about that.

The issue, before I continue and forget to mention it, is this:

* e-readers offer no real way to store user notes or related information well.

There are notes, there are highlighters, there are other solutions - but none of
them work well for me. I suppose you could define the core problem as:

* e-readers do not use being digital to the fullest advantage.

However, that one is a little big for me to tackle right now.

A specific case of this, which comes up pretty often for me, is keeping track of
characters in a novel. My genre of choice is sci-fi. This means sometimes long,
often obscure names for characters. This would be bad enough, but I have a
habit of reading up until half-way in a book before leaving it for a matter of
months. Because of this, I've been known to start a book again *just* because I
forgot who one character was.

If, however, I could select a characters name and enter some relevant
information, or select an in-book descriptor of them to store alongside the name,
the problem would go away. I could update this value as I go through the book, if
I like, or I could leave it at the first setting. I could do the same for events,
items, and anything else that I might not remember. I would be, in effect, making
my own knowledge-base around the book.

Needless to say, this would be useful for other forms of book, and not just
fiction, this is just the case that comes up most for me.

Vitally, I feel like the problem is with how e-readers approach the format, rather
than an issue with how an ebook is stored, I think that any of the features that
really took advantage of the platform would be on the display level, and would
have no reason not to be format-agnostic.

My next step, I think, is to look into producing this system without an e-reader.
This way, I focus on solving the problem in a repeatable way. This part
shouldn't be amazingly complex, but I'd like to do it as well as I can. After
this, I'll look into possibly applying this solution to an existing reader, or
building something basic with my solution.

In the coming weeks, I'm planning on looking into using a key-value store with
text to begin coming up with a solution, as well as starting to look at a really
simple reader so I can implement my ideas on something that exists.

Of course, I may be overlooking an existing solution, in the current absence of
a commenting system, drop me an issue on the repo for this
[blog](https://github.com/sjmarshy/sjmarshy.github.io/issues) and let me know.
